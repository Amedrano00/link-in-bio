Link-in-bio-project

In this project I created a customized link-in-bio website for social media profiles, to easily allow users to view different links I have offered. 
- able to make a website that worked on desktops and on phone
- able to use anchors/attributes to link images and links/social links
- able to use CCS to attract users to website
- was able to create a free linktree website
- Using github/codespace, i would commit and sync as consistently as possible while working thru the code
- till the last commit, to be published, and deployed as a live website thru render
